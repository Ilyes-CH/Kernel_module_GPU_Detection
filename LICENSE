 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

 The purpose of this License is to make a manual, reference
 material, or software program—free in the sense of freedom, not
 price—available to the public, and ensure that it remains free.
 We, the authors of this License, have invested substantial effort
 in developing this software, and we hope that it will be useful to
 others. In return, we want to make sure that everyone who receives
 a copy of this software can use it, modify it, and distribute it,
 under the terms of this License.

 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that ensure you
 have the freedom to share and change the software. We, therefore,
 have to forbid you to add restrictions on these rights. For example,
 you must not impose a license that restricts others from modifying
 the software or limit its use for any purpose. These are the
 requirements for distributing copies of the software and for
 modifying it.
